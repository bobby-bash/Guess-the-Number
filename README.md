Explenation to the code:

If you execute this code its going to import the random number from 1 to 99.
After that you have to try to find the number.

If your input is Higher than that numeber it returns "Your guess is high".

If your input is Lower than that number it returns "Your guess is Low".

If your input is Equel to that number it returns "You guessed it"

This is the basic explanation of this code.

Thank You..!!
